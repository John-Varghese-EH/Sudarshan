## üöÄ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Threat Analysis**: Users can submit messages, emails, or other text to an AI model that analyzes it for potential security threats, such as phishing, scams, or malicious intent.
- **End-to-End Encrypted Chat**: A real-time chat application demonstrating symmetric end-to-end encryption using AES. Messages are encrypted on the client-side, stored as ciphertext in Firestore, and decrypted only by the recipient.
- **Interactive Encryption Demo**: A hands-on tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shared secret key, providing a clear visualization of how symmetric encryption works.
- **Educational Resources**: A dedicated page with articles and resources on various cybersecurity topics.
- **Modern, Responsive UI**: A sleek and intuitive user interface built with ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great experience on all devices.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and sign-in functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack:

- **Framework**: [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) (with React and TypeScript) - For a high-performance, server-rendered React application.
- **Generative AI**: [**Google's Genkit**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) - An open-source framework for building production-ready, AI-powered features and flows.
- **UI Components**: [**ShadCN UI**](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and composable components.
- **Styling**: [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent UI development.
- **Database**: [**Firestore**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) - A flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database for the real-time chat and other application data.
- **Hosting**: Deployed on [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/) for continuous integration, global scale, and reliability.
- **Encryption**: [**crypto-js**](https://github.com/brix/crypto-js) - For implementing AES client-side encryption.

## üîí End-to-End Encryption Model

The application demonstrates end-to-end encryption using the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm. This is a form of **symmetric encryption**, meaning the same secret key is used to both encrypt and decrypt data.

Here‚Äôs how it works in the **Chat Demo**:

1.  **Client-Side Encryption**: Before a message is sent, it is encrypted in the user's browser using a shared secret key with the `crypto-js` library.
2.  **Ciphertext Transmission**: Only the encrypted, unreadable text (ciphertext) is sent over the network and stored in the Firestore database. The server never sees or stores the plaintext message.
3.  **Client-Side Decryption**: When the recipient receives the message, their browser uses the same shared secret key to decrypt the ciphertext back into readable plaintext.

This model ensures that the conversation remains private and secure. The **Encryption Demo** page provides a live, hands-on tool to explore this process interactively.
